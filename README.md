# Lorann Project
## Synopsis

This project is to rebuild an old abandonware game of 1985, **the Lorann**. It is a game similar to PacMan but here we need to collect hundreds of objects without getting caught by 4 horrible monsters. The main character is able to throw a magical spell to kill the monsters. But the difficulty is that he only has one fireball, to gain a new one he need to kill a monster or to pick up the previous one. The player will need to think about a strategy to kill the monsters and exit the level.
